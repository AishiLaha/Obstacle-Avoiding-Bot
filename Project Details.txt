An obstacle avoiding bot built with Arduino UNO,
1 Ultrasonic Sensor module (HCSR04)
controlled by 2 wheels driven by motordriver IC L293D.

There are many algorithms for avoiding obstacles using many sensors.
There are lazer techniques, other EM wave bands techniques are used by many other sensors,
There are even imaging techniques with object detections and identification algorithm.
More then one sensors such as ultrasonic sensors are used for the same purpose.

My goal is to come up with a basic model and the best possible algorithm to achieve the same task,
using only one sensor and two wheels.

The project is still into development to find even better an algorithm to achieve the above task,
thus being more power efficient, less complex and thus achieving the task at a low processing power.
