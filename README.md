Obstacle-Avoiding-Bot
===


**An obstacle avoiding bot built with:**
* 1 Arduino UNO,
* 1 Ultrasonic Sensor module (HCSR04).


**controlled by:** 
* (2 wheeled) driven by Motor Driver IC L293D.


There are many algorithms for avoiding obstacles using many sensors and controllers. There are various sensors such as laser sensors, various sensors using various EM wave bands and techniques, There are even imaging techniques with object detections, image recognition and identification techniques. Sometimes there are more than one sensors being used, In some cases, a combination of sensors are even being used.

My goal is *Simple*, to come up with a *basic model* and the **best possible algorithm** to achieve obstacle detection and avoiding them **using only one sensor and two-wheel control system**.

My objective is to come up with the most elegant and the most effective Algorithm to achieve the task with only one sensor. Thus being *more power efficient, less complex* and thus achieving the task at a *low processing power*.


*The project is still into development to find even better an algorithm to achieve the above task.*
